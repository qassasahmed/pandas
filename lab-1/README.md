# Python Basic Data Types

In Python, data types are the classification of data items. Python provides a variety of data types to support different kinds of information.

## 1. Integers
Integers are whole numbers, either positive or negative, without decimal points. They belong to the `int` class in Python.

```python
x = 10
y = -7
z = 0
```

### Example:
```python
x = 5
y = -12
print(x + y)  # Output: -7
```

## 2. Floats
Floats represent numbers with decimal points. They belong to the `float` class.

```python
pi = 3.14159
height = 5.7
```

### Example:
```python
a = 5.2
b = 3.1
print(a + b)  # Output: 8.3
```

## 3. Strings
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. They are represented by the `str` class.

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, world!'
```

### Example:
```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
```

## 4. Booleans
Booleans represent two values: `True` or `False`. They are commonly used in conditional statements and belong to the `bool` class.

```python
is_valid = True
is_active = False
```

### Example:
```python
age = 20
is_adult = age >= 18  # True
print(is_adult)  # Output: True
```
